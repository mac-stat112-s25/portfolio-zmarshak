Use this file to generate a professional looking **univariate** visualization. The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
# import data
hikes <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv")
```

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Histogram of the elevations of hikes in the Adrinondack Moutains. Created by Zach Marshak, Feb. 2025"
#| fig-alt: "Histogram of the elevations of hikes in the Adirondack Mountains. The range of elevation is between 4250 and 5500 feet, with the typical elevation of a hike being between 4000 and 4500 feet."
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 200) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of Hikes", title = "Elevation of hikes in the Adirondacks")+
  theme_minimal()
