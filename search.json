Try running the following chunk and simply take note of the error message – this is one you’ll get a lot!\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n# Use the ggplot function\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to use ggplot tools, we have to first load the tidyverse package in which they live. We’ve installed the package but we need to tell R when we want to use it. Run the chunk below to load the library. You’ll need to do this within any .qmd file that uses ggplot().\n\n# Load the package\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nExercise 3: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 1\nConsider some specific research questions about the difficulty rating of the hikes:\n\nHow many hikes fall into each category?\nAre the hikes evenly distributed among these categories, or are some more common than others?\n\nAll of these questions can be answered with: (1) a bar chart; of (2) the categorical data recorded in the rating column. First, set up the plotting frame:\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about:\n\nWhat did this do? What do you observe? It created a bar chart however each category is the same color, it is hard to tell the difference between them\nWhat, in general, is the first argument of the ggplot() function? to plot the “hikes” data\nWhat is the purpose of writing x = rating? to have our x plot as the raiting\nWhat do you think aes stands for?!? what we are ploting aesthics\nExercise 4: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 2\nNow let’s add a geometric layer to the frame / canvas, and start customizing the plot’s theme. To this end, try each chunk below, one by one. In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.\nNOTE:\n\nPay attention to the general code properties and structure, not memorization.\nNot all of these are “good” plots. We’re just exploring ggplot.\n\n\n# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"orange\", fill = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"orange\", fill = \"blue\")  +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5: Bar Chart Follow-up\nPart a\nReflect on the ggplot() code.\n\nWhat’s the purpose of the +? When do we use it? To add an additional layer to our plot\nWe added the bars using geom_bar()? Why “geom”? because they are a geometric elemenst we are ading and bar is what we are adding\nWhat does labs() stand for? labels\nWhat’s the difference between color and fill? the color is the outline of each bar while fill is the file color of each bar\nPart b\nIn general, bar charts allow us to examine the following properties of a categorical variable:\n\n\nobserved categories: What categories did we observe? the amount of hikes and the ratings\n\nvariability between categories: Are observations evenly spread out among the categories, or are some categories more common than others? they are not evenly spread there are much more moderate hikes than the other two\n\nWe must then translate this information into the context of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Summarize below what you learned from the bar chart, in context.\n-the majority of the hikes in the Adirondacks are moderately rated hikes while and some easy reated hikes but only a few difficult hikes.\nPart c\nIs there anything you don’t like about this barplot? For example: check out the x-axis again.\n-It would make more sense if they were by difficulty instead of alphabetically\nExercise 6: Sad Bar Chart\nLet’s now consider some research questions related to the quantitative elevation variable:\n\nAmong the hikes, what’s the range of elevation and how are the hikes distributed within this range (e.g. evenly, in clumps, “normally”)?\nWhat’s a typical elevation?\nAre there any outliers, i.e. hikes that have unusually high or low elevations?\n\nHere:\n\nConstruct a bar chart of the quantitative elevation variable.\nExplain why this might not be an effective visualization for this and other quantitative variables. (What questions does / doesn’t it help answer?) It is good at showing us the range and distribution in the range but it isn’t good at showing us outliers and typical or average elevation\n\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\ngeom_bar(color = \"orange\", fill = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"elevation\", y= \"number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7: A Histogram of Elevation\nQuantitative variables require different viz than categorical variables. Especially when there are many possible outcomes of the quantitative variable. It’s typically insufficient to simply count up the number of times we’ve observed a particular outcome as the bar graph did above. It gives us a sense of ranges and typical outcomes, but not a good sense of how the observations are distributed across this range. We’ll explore two methods for graphing quantitative variables: histograms and density plots.\nHistograms are constructed by (1) dividing up the observed range of the variable into ‘bins’ of equal width; and (2) counting up the number of cases that fall into each bin. Check out the example below:\n\nPart a\nLet’s dig into some details.\n\nHow many hikes have an elevation between 4500 and 4700 feet?\n6\nHow many total hikes have an elevation of at least 5100 feet?\n2\nPart b\nNow the bigger picture. In general, histograms allow us to examine the following properties of a quantitative variable:\n\n\ntypical outcome: Where’s the center of the data points? What’s typical?\n\nvariability & range: How spread out are the outcomes? What are the max and min outcomes?\n\nshape: How are values distributed along the observed range? Is the distribution symmetric, right-skewed, left-skewed, bi-modal, or uniform (flat)?\n\noutliers: Are there any outliers, i.e. outcomes that are unusually large/small?\n\nWe must then translate this information into the context of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Addressing each of the features in the above list, summarize below what you learned from the histogram, in context.\nExercise 8: Building Histograms - Part 1\n2-MINUTE CHALLENGE: Thinking of the bar chart code, try to intuit what line you can tack on to the below frame of elevation to add a histogram layer. Don’t forget a +. If it doesn’t come to you within 2 minutes, no problem – all will be revealed in the next exercise.\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9: Building Histograms - Part 2\nLet’s build some histograms. Try each chunk below, one by one.

Instead of sorting observations into discrete bins, the “density” of observations is calculated across the entire range of outcomes. The greater the number of observations, the greater the density! The density is then scaled so that the area under the density curve always equals 1 and the area under any fraction of the curve represents the fraction of cases that lie in that range.\nCheck out a density plot of elevation. Notice that the y-axis (density) has no contextual interpretation – it’s a relative measure. The higher the density, the more common are elevations in that range.\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\nINTUITION CHECK: Before tweaking the code and thinking back to geom_bar() and geom_histogram(), how do you anticipate the following code will change the plot?\n\ngeom_density(color = \"blue\")\ngeom_density(fill = \"orange\")\n\n\nTRY IT! Test out those lines in the chunk below. Was your intuition correct?\n\n\nExamine the density plot. How does it compare to the histogram? What does it tell you about the typical elevation, variability / range in elevations, and shape of the distribution of elevations within this range?\nExercise 12: Density Plots vs Histograms\nThe histogram and density plot both allow us to visualize the behavior of a quantitative variable: typical outcome, variability / range, shape, and outliers. What are the pros/cons of each? What do you like/not like about each?\nExercise 13: Code = communication\nWe obviously won’t be done until we talk about communication. All code above has a similar general structure (where the details can change):\n\nggplot(___, aes(x = ___)) + \n  geom___(color = \"___\", fill = \"___\") + \n  labs(x = \"___\", y = \"___\")\n\n\nThough not necessary to the code working, it’s common, good practice to indent or tab the lines of code after the first line (counterexample below). Why?\n\n\n# YUCK\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\ngeom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) +\nlabs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough not necessary to the code working, it’s common, good practice to put a line break after each + (counterexample below). Why?\n\n\n# YUCK \nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) + geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) + labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 14: Practice\nPart a\nPractice your viz skills to learn about some of the variables in one of the following datasets from the previous class:\n\n# Data on students in this class\nsurvey &lt;- read.csv(\"https://hash-mac.github.io/stat112site-s25/data/survey.csv\")\n\n# World Cup data\nworld_cup &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-11-29/worldcups.csv\")\n\nPart b\nCheck out the RStudio Data Visualization cheat sheet to learn more features of ggplot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck → Commit → Push\n\n\n\nWhen done, don’t forgot to click Render Book and check the resulting HTML files.

Notice that:\n\nboth variables are quantitative, and get their own axes\nthe response variable is on the y-axis, demonstrating how repub_pct_20 might be predicted by repub_pct_16, not vice versa\n\nTry to replicate this using ggplot(). THINK:\n\nWhat info do you need to set up the canvas?\nWhat geometric layer (geom_???) might add these dots / points for each county? We haven’t learned this yet, just take some guesses.\n\n\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_16 , y = repub_pct_20))+\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2: 2 Quantitiative Variables\nRun each chunk below to build up a a scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs repub_pct_16 with different glyphs representing each county. Address or think about any prompts in the comments (#).\n\n# Set up the plotting frame\n# How does this differ than the frame for our histogram of repub_pct_20 alone? It has two depdent variables on it.\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16))\n\n\n# Add a layer of points for each county\n# Take note of the geom!\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n# Change the shape of the points\n# What happens if you change the shape to another number? it changes the shape of the points\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point(shape = 1)\n\n\n# YOU TRY: Modify the code to make the points \"orange\"\n# NOTE: Try to anticipate if \"color\" or \"fill\" will be useful here. Then try both.\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"orange\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Add a layer that represents each county by the state it's in\n# Take note of the geom and the info it needs to run! \nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = state_abbr))\n\nExercise 3: Reflect\nSummarize the relationship between the Republican support in 2020 and 2016. Be sure to comment on:\n\nthe strength of the relationship (weak/moderate/strong)\n\nthe direction of the relationship (positive/negative)\n\noutliers (in what state do counties deviate from the national trend? Any ideas why this might be the case?)\nIt is a strong relation because it is mostly linear. The direction the realationship is positive as there is a increase in support from 2016 to 2020. DC and Texas seem to be an outliers\nExercise 4: Visualizing trend\nThe trend of the relationship between repub_pct_20 and repub_pct_16 is clearly positive and (mostly) linear. We can highlight this trend by adding a model “smooth” to the plot:\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth()\n\nPart a\nConstruct a new plot that contains the model smooth but does not include the individual point glyphs.\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_16 , x = repub_pct_20))+\n  geom_smooth()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = \"cs\")'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nBy default, geom_smooth() adds a smooth, localized model line. To examine the “best” linear model, we can specify method = \"lm\". It’s pretty similar in this example!\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\nExercise 5: Your Turn\nTo examine how the 2020 results are related to some county demographics, construct scatterplots of repub_pct_20 vs median_rent, and repub_pct_20 vs median_age. Summarize the relationship between these two variables and comment on which is the better predictor of repub_pct_20, median_rent or median_age.\n\nmedian rent is a better predictor as there is a strong negative association, the lower the rent the higher Republican support, while there is only a moderate postative association\n\n\n# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_rent\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = median_rent))+\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_age\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = median_age))+\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6: A Sad Scatterplot\nNext, let’s explore the relationship between a county’s 2020 Republican support repub_pct_20 and the historical political trends in its state. In this case repub_pct_20 is quantitative, but historical is categorical. Explain why a scatterplot might not be an effective visualization for exploring this relationship. (What questions does / doesn’t it help answer?)\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7: Quantitative vs Categorical – Violins & Boxes\nThough the above scatterplot did group the counties by historical category, it’s nearly impossible to pick out meaningful patterns in 2020 Republican support in each category. Let’s try adding 2 different geom layers to the frame:\n\n# Side-by-side violin plots\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n# Side-by-side boxplots (defined below)\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\nBox plots are constructed from five numbers - the minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum value of a quantitative variable:\n\nREFLECT:\nSummarize what you’ve learned about the 2020 Republican county-level support within and between red/purple/blue states.\n\nthere is decent amount of range in support each of the historical catagories but support tends to be higher in historically red counties and lower in blue\nExercise 8: Quantitative vs Categorical – Intuition Check\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Quick\n\n\n\nDon’t spend more than 3 minutes on this!\n\n\nWe can also visualize the relationship between repub_pct_20 and historical using our familiar density plots. In the plot below, notice that we simply created a separate density plot for each historical category. (The plot itself is “bad” but we’ll fix it below.) Try to adjust the code chunk below, which starts with a density plot of repub_pct_20 alone, to re-create this image.\n\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9: Quantitative vs Categorical – Density Plots\nWork through the chunks below and address the comments therein.\n\n# The colors don't match the labels\n#the denisty plots are covering each other\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n# scale_fill_manual changes the fill color of each catageory in the order you put it in\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n\n# alpha = 0.5 makes the fill color more transparent \n# Play around with different values of alpha, between 0 and 1\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n\n# facet_wrap creates sepearate graphs for each historical group/catagory\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\")) +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n# Let's try a similar grouping strategy with a histogram instead of density plot.\n# This is terrible because it makes it hard to read the data, I can't tell what is trying to be visualized in this, each historical catagory is stacked on top of each making it difficult to know what its denisty is \nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))+\n\nExercise 10\nWe’ve now learned 3 (of many) ways to visualize the relationship between a quantitative and categorical variable: side-by-side violins, boxplots, and density plots.\n\nWhich do you like best?\nthe density plot\nWhat is one pro of density plots relative to boxplots?\nit doesn’t over simplify data as compared to boxplots which catagorizes data\nWhat is one con of density plots relative to boxplots?\nbox plots are easier to interpret\nExercise 11: Categorical vs Categorical – Intuition Check\nFinally, let’s simply explore who won each county in 2020 (winner_20) and how this breaks down by historical voting trends in the state. That is, let’s explore the relationship between 2 categorical variables! Following the same themes as above, we can utilize grouping features such as fill/color or facets to distinguish between different categories of winner_20 and historical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Quick\n\n\n\nSpend at most 5 minutes on the following intuition check. Adjust the code below to recreate the following two plots.\n\n\n\n\n# Plot 1: adjust this to recreate the top plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Plot 2: adjust this to recreate the bottom plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar()+\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 12: Categorical vs Categorical\nConstruct the following 4 bar plot visualizations.\n\n# A stacked bar plot\n# historical = x axis \n# winner = fill of bars\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n# A faceted bar plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n# A side-by-side bar plot\n# Note the new argument to geom_bar = postion = dodge\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n\n\n# A proportional bar plot\n# Note the new argument to geom_bar postion = fill\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n\nPart a\nName one pro and one con of using the “proportional bar plot” instead of one of the other three options.\n\nOne pro is that it makes easeir to compaer outcomes\none con is you are no longer able to count how many counties in each historical group\nPart b\nWhat’s your favorite bar plot from part and why?\n\nside by side beacuse it is easiet to read and allows you to keep count\nExercise 13: Practice (now or later)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecide\n\n\n\nDecide what’s best for you:\n\nTry this extra practice now.\nReflect on the above exercises and come back to this extra practice later (but before the next class).\n\n\n\nImport some daily weather data from a few locations in Australia:\n\nweather &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv\")\n\nConstruct plots that address the research questions in each chunk.

For example:\n\ngeom___(fill = \"blue\")named colors are defined outside the aesthetics and put in quotes\ngeom___(aes(fill = variable)) or ggplot(___, aes(fill = variable))\ncolors/fills defined by a variable are defined inside the aesthetics\nExample 3\nLet’s consider Wollongong alone:\n\n# Don't worry about the syntax (we'll learn it soon)\nwoll &lt;- weather |&gt;\n  filter(location == \"Wollongong\") |&gt; \n  mutate(date = as.Date(date))  \n\n\n# How often does it raintoday?\n# Fill your geometric layer with the color blue.\nggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  geom_bar( fill = \"blue\")\n\ngeom_bar: just = 0.5, width = NULL, na.rm = FALSE, orientation = NA\nstat_count: width = NULL, na.rm = FALSE, orientation = NA\nposition_stack \n\n\n\n# If it does raintoday, what does this tell us about raintomorrow?\n# Use your intuition first\nggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday))+ \n  geom_bar(aes(fill = raintomorrow))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Now compare different approaches\n\n# Default: stacked bars\nggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow)) + \n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Side-by-side bars\nggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow)) + \n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Proportional bars\n# position = \"fill\" refers to filling the frame, nothing to do with the color-related fill\nggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow)) + \n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection\nThere’s often not one “best plot”, but a combination of plots that provide a complete picture:\n\nThe stacked and side-by-side bars reflect that on most days, it does not rain.\nThe proportional / filled bars lose that information, but make it easier to compare proportions: it’s more likely to rain tomorrow if it also rains today.\nExample 4\nConstruct a plot that illustrates how 3pm temperatures (temp3pm) vary by date in Wollongong.

    "text": "9.2 New Stuff\nNext, let’s consider the entire weather data for all 3 locations. The addition of location adds a 3rd variable into our research questions:\n\nHow does the relationship between raintoday and raintomorrow vary by location?\nHow does the behavior of temp3pm over date vary by location?\nAnd so on.\n\nThus far, we’ve focused on the following components of a plot:\n\nsetting up a frame\n\nadding layers / geometric elements\nsplitting the plot into facets for different groups / categories\nchange the theme, e.g. axis labels, color, fill\n\nWe’ll have to think about all of this, along with scales. Scales change the color, fill, size, shape, or other properties according to the levels of a new variable. This is different than just assigning scale by, for example, color = \"blue\".\nWork on the examples below in your groups. Check in with your intuition! We’ll then discuss as a group as relevant.\nExample 5\n\n# Plot temp3pm vs temp9am\n# Change the code in order to indicate the location to which each data point corresponds\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location)) + \n  geom_point()\n\nWarning: Removed 27 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Change the code in order to indicate the location to which each data point corresponds\n# AND identify the days on which it rained / didn't raintoday\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location)) + \n  geom_point()+\n  facet_wrap(~ raintoday)\n\nWarning: Removed 27 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# How many ways can you think to make that plot of temp3pm vs temp9am with info about location and rain?\n# Play around!\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location)) + \n  geom_line()+\n  facet_wrap(~ raintoday)\n\nWarning: Removed 15 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_line()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6\n\n# Change the code in order to construct a line plot of temp3pm vs date for each separate location (no points!)\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = date, color = location)) + \n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 7\n\n# Plot the relationship of raintomorrow & raintoday\n# Change the code in order to indicate this relationship by location\nggplot(weather, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow)) + \n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")+\n  facet_wrap(~ location)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Not Get Overwhelmed?\n\n\n\nThere’s no end to the number and type of visualizations you could make. And it’s important to not just throw spaghetti at the wall until something sticks. FlowingData shows that one dataset can be visualized many ways, and makes good recommendations for data viz workflow, which we modify and build upon here:\n\nIdentify simple research questions.\nWhat do you want to understand about the variables or the relationships among them?\n\nStart with the basics and work incrementally.\n\nIdentify what variables you want to include in your plot and what structure these have (eg: categorical, quantitative, dates)\nStart simply. Build a plot of just 1 of these variables, or the relationship between 2 of these variables.\nSet up a plotting frame and add just one geometric layer at a time.\nStart tweaking: add whatever new variables you want to examine,\n\n\n\nAsk your plot questions.\n\nWhat questions does your plot answer? What questions are left unanswered by your plot?\nWhat new questions does your plot spark / inspire?\nDo you have the viz tools to answer these questions, or might you learn more?\n\n\n\nThe story\nThough far from a perfect assessment of academic preparedness, SAT scores have historically been used as one measurement of a state’s education system. The education dataset contains various education variables for each state:\n\n# Import and check out data\neducation &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/sat.csv\")\nhead(education)\n\n       State expend ratio salary frac verbal math  sat  fracCat\n1    Alabama  4.405  17.2 31.144    8    491  538 1029   (0,15]\n2     Alaska  8.963  17.6 47.951   47    445  489  934 (45,100]\n3    Arizona  4.778  19.3 32.175   27    448  496  944  (15,45]\n4   Arkansas  4.459  17.1 28.934    6    482  523 1005   (0,15]\n5 California  4.992  24.0 41.078   45    417  485  902  (15,45]\n6   Colorado  5.443  18.4 34.571   29    462  518  980  (15,45]\n\n\nA codebook is provided by Danny Kaplan who also made these data accessible:\n\nExercise 1: SAT scores\nPart a\nConstruct a plot of how the average sat scores vary from state to state. (Just use 1 variable – sat not State!)\n\nggplot(education, aes(x = sat))+\n  geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nSummarize your observations from the plot. Comment on the basics: range, typical outcomes, shape. (Any theories about what might explain this non-normal shape?)\n\nSat scores ranged from around 840 to around 1120 with thw typical score being around 900. It is somewhat right skewed however it is not very definitive\nExercise 2: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending & SAT Scores vs Salaries\nThe first question we’d like to answer is: Can the variability in sat scores from state to state be partially explained by how much a state spends on education, specifically its per pupil spending (expend) and typical teacher salary?\nPart a\n\n# Construct a plot of sat vs expend\n# Include a \"best fit linear regression model\" (HINT: method = \"lm\")\nggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = expend))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Construct a plot of sat vs salary\n# Include a \"best fit linear regression model\" (HINT: method = \"lm\")\nggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nWhat are the relationship trends between SAT scores and spending? Is there anything that surprises you?\n\nHigher salaries and expendatures didn’t relate to higher Sat scores it was actually some what the opposite.\nExercise 3: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending and Teacher Salaries\nConstruct one visualization of the relationship of sat with salary and expend. HINT: Start with just 2 variables and tweak that code to add the third variable. Try out a few things!\n\nggplot(education, aes(x = sat, y = salary, color = expend))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: The following aesthetics were dropped during statistical transformation:\ncolour.\nℹ This can happen when ggplot fails to infer the correct grouping structure in\n  the data.\nℹ Did you forget to specify a `group` aesthetic or to convert a numerical\n  variable into a factor?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Another way to Incorporate Scale\nIt can be tough to distinguish color scales and size scales for quantitative variables. Another option is to discretize a quantitative variable, or basically cut it up into categories.\nConstruct the plot below. Check out the code and think about what’s happening here. What happens if you change “2” to “3”?\n\nggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = cut(expend, 2))) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = \"lm\")\n\nDescribe the trivariate relationship between sat, salary, and expend.\n\nstates with lower salaries have lower expenditures and then tend to have higher SAT scores.\nExercise 5: Finally an Explanation\nIt’s strange that SAT scores seem to decrease with spending. But we’re leaving out an important variable from our analysis: the fraction of a state’s students that actually take the SAT. The fracCat variable indicates this fraction: low (under 15% take the SAT), medium (15-45% take the SAT), and high (at least 45% take the SAT).\nPart a\nBuild a univariate viz of fracCat to better understand how many states fall into each category.\n\nggplot(education, aes(x = fracCat))+\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nBuild 2 bivariate visualizations that demonstrate the relationship between sat and fracCat. What story does your graphic tell and why does this make contextual sense?\n\nggplot(education, aes(x = sat, fill = fracCat))+\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(education, aes(x = sat, fill = fracCat))+\n  geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart c\nMake a trivariate visualization that demonstrates the relationship of sat with expend AND fracCat. Highlight the differences in fracCat groups through color AND unique trend lines. What story does your graphic tell?\nDoes it still seem that SAT scores decrease as spending increases?\n\nggplot(education, aes(x = sat , y = expend, color= fracCat))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart d\nPutting all of this together, explain this example of Simpson’s Paradox. That is, why did it appear that SAT scores decrease as spending increases even though the opposite is true?\n-A greater number of observation will often lower the average, so in this case because states with higher funding had a higher ration of students take the sat the average was lower in states with higher funding.\n\n9.3 Exercises (optional)\nExercise 6: Heat Maps\nAs usual, we’ve only just scratched the surface! There are lots of other data viz techniques for exploring multivariate relationships. Let’s start with a heat map.\nPart a\nRun the chunks below. Check out the code, but don’t worry about every little detail! NOTES:\n\nThis is not part of the ggplot() grammar, making it a bit complicated.\nIf you’re curious about what a line in the plot does, comment it out (#) and check out what happens!\nIn the plot, for each state (row), each variable (column) is scaled to indicate whether the state has a relative high value (yellow), a relatively low value (purple), or something in between (blues/greens).\nYou can also play with the color scheme. Type ?cm.colors in the console to learn about various options.\nWe’ll improve the plot later, so don’t spend too much time trying to learn something from this plot.\n\n\n# Remove the \"State\" column and use it to label the rows\n# Then scale the variables\nplot_data &lt;- education |&gt; \n  column_to_rownames(\"State\") |&gt; \n  data.matrix() |&gt; \n  scale()\n\n# Load the gplots package needed for heatmaps\nlibrary(gplots)\n\n# Construct heatmap 1\nheatmap.2(plot_data,\n  dendrogram = \"none\",\n  Rowv = NA, \n  scale = \"column\",\n  keysize = 0.7, \n  density.info = \"none\",\n  col = hcl.colors(256), \n  margins = c(10, 20),\n  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),\n  sepcolor = \"white\", trace = \"none\"\n)\n\n\n# Construct heatmap 2\nheatmap.2(plot_data,\n  dendrogram = \"none\",\n  Rowv = TRUE,             ### WE CHANGED THIS FROM NA TO TRUE\n  scale = \"column\",\n  keysize = 0.7, \n  density.info = \"none\",\n  col = hcl.colors(256), \n  margins = c(10, 20),\n  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),\n  sepcolor = \"white\", trace = \"none\"\n)\n\n\n# Construct heatmap 3\nheatmap.2(plot_data,\n  dendrogram = \"row\",       ### WE CHANGED THIS FROM \"none\" TO \"row\"\n  Rowv = TRUE,            \n  scale = \"column\",\n  keysize = 0.7, \n  density.info = \"none\",\n  col = hcl.colors(256), \n  margins = c(10, 20),\n  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),\n  sepcolor = \"white\", trace = \"none\"\n)\n\nPart b\nIn the final two plots, the states (rows) are rearranged by similarity with respect to these education metrics. The final plot includes a dendrogram which further indicates clusters of similar states. In short, states that have a shorter path to connection are more similar than others.\nPutting this all together, what insight do you gain about the education trends across U.S. states? Which states are similar? In what ways are they similar? Are there any outliers with respect to 1 or more of the education metrics?\nExercise 7: Star plots\nLike heat maps, star plots indicate the relative scale of each variable for each state. Thus, we can use star maps to identify similar groups of states, and unusual states!\nPart a\nConstruct and check out the star plot below. Note that each state has a “pie”, with each segment corresponding to a different variable. The larger a segment, the larger that variable’s value is in that state. For example:\n\nCheck out Minnesota. How does Minnesota’s education metrics compare to those in other states? What metrics are relatively high? Relatively low?\nWhat states appear to be similar? Do these observations agree with those that you gained from the heat map?\n\n\nstars(plot_data,\n  flip.labels = FALSE,\n  key.loc = c(10, 1.5),\n  cex = 1, \n  draw.segments = TRUE\n)\n\nPart b\nFinally, let’s plot the state stars by geographic location! What new insight do you gain here?!\n\nstars(plot_data,\n  flip.labels = FALSE,\n  locations = data.matrix(as.data.frame(state.center)),  # added external data to arrange by geo location\n  key.loc = c(-110, 28),\n  cex = 1, \n  draw.segments = TRUE\n)",

Refer to the class website for details.\n\n10.0.1 Preview\nYou’ll explore some R spatial viz tools below. In general, there are two important pieces to every map:\nPiece 1: A dataset\nThis dataset must include either:\n\nlocation coordinates for your points of interest (for point maps); or\nvariable outcomes for your regions of interest (for choropleth maps)\n\n\nPiece 2: A background map\nWe need latitude and longitude coordinates to specify the boundaries for your regions of interest (eg: countries, states). This is where it gets really sticky!\n\nCounty-level, state-level, country-level, continent-level info live in multiple places.\nWhere we grab this info can depend upon whether we want to make a point map or a choropleth map. (The background maps can be used somewhat interchangeably, but it requires extra code :/)\nWhere we grab this info can also depend upon the structure of our data and how much data wrangling / cleaning we’re up for. For choropleth maps, the labels of regions in our data must match those in the background map. For example, if our data labels states with their abbreviations (eg: MN) and the background map refers to them as full names in lower case (eg: minnesota), we have to wrangle our data so that it matches the background map.\n\nIn short, the code for spatial viz gets very specialized. The goal of these exercises is to:\n\nplay around and experience the wide variety of spatial viz tools out there\nunderstand the difference between point maps and choropleth maps\nhave fun\n\nYou can skip around as you wish and it’s totally fine if you don’t finish everything. Just come back at some point to play around.\nPart 1: Interactive points on a map with leaflet\n\nLeaflet is an open-source JavaScript library for creating maps. We can use it inside R through the leaflet package.\nThis uses a different plotting framework than ggplot2, but still has a tidyverse feel (which will become more clear as we learn other tidyverse tools!).\nThe general steps are as follows:\n\nCreate a map widget by calling leaflet() and telling it the data to use.\nAdd a base map using addTiles() (the default) or addProviderTiles().\nAdd layers to the map using layer functions (e.g. addMarkers(), addPolygons()).\nPrint the map widget to display it.\nExercise 1: A leaflet with markers / points\nEarlier this semester, I asked for the latitude and longitude of one of your favorite places. I rounded these to the nearest whole number, so that they’re near to but not exactly at those places. Let’s load the data and map it!\n\nfave_places &lt;- read.csv(\"https://hash-mac.github.io/stat112site-s25/data/our_fave_places.csv\")\n\n# Check it out\nhead(fave_places)\n\n  latitude longitude\n1       59        18\n2       45       -93\n3       33      -117\n4       40       116\n5       40       106\n6       37      -122\n\n\nPart a\nYou can use a “two-finger scroll” to zoom in and out.\n\n# Load the leaflet package\nlibrary(leaflet)\n\n# Just a plotting frame\nleaflet(data = fave_places)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# we have a basic map without any of our plots\nleaflet(data = fave_places) |&gt; \n  addTiles()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# we have have a map that has our cordinates ploted\n# longitude and latitude refer to the variables in our data\nleaflet(data = fave_places) |&gt; \n  addTiles() |&gt; \n  addMarkers(lng = ~longitude, lat = ~latitude)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Since we named them \"longitude\" and \"latitude\", the function\n# automatically recognizes these variables. No need to write them!\nleaflet(data = fave_places) |&gt; \n  addTiles() |&gt; \n  addMarkers()\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nPLAY AROUND! This map is interactive. Zoom in on one location. Keep zooming – what level of detail can you get into? Youcan can get basic street level information How does that detail depend upon where you try to zoom in (thus what are the limitations of this tool)? In some place you can see building outlines while in other places you can’t, depends on the data provided\nExercise 2: Details\nWe can change all sorts of details in leaflet maps. # Check if gplots is already installed. If not, install it with a mirror specified. if(!require(gplots)){ # Use require() for conditional loading and installation chooseCRANmirror() # Or set it directly:\n\n  options(repos=c(CRAN=\"https://cloud.r-project.org\"))\n  install.packages(\"gplots\")\n\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n    /var/folders/50/81nzyvws449dbqrxl05vf1cr0000gn/T//Rtmp8vig0e/downloaded_packages\n\n\n\n# Load package needed to change color\ninstall.packages(\"gplots\")\n\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n    /var/folders/50/81nzyvws449dbqrxl05vf1cr0000gn/T//Rtmp8vig0e/downloaded_packages\n\nlibrary(gplots)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'gplots'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    lowess\n\n# We can add colored circles instead of markers at each location\nleaflet(data = fave_places) |&gt; \n  addTiles() |&gt; \n  addCircles(color = col2hex(\"red\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# We can change the background\n# Mark locations with yellow dots\n# And connect the dots, in their order in the dataset, with green lines\n# (These green lines don't mean anything here, but would if this were somebody's travel path!)\nleaflet(data = fave_places) |&gt;\n  addProviderTiles(\"USGS\") |&gt;\n  addCircles(weight = 10, opacity = 1, color = col2hex(\"yellow\")) |&gt;\n  addPolylines(\n    lng = ~longitude,\n    lat = ~latitude,\n    color = col2hex(\"green\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general:\n\naddProviderTiles() changes the base map.\nTo explore all available provider base maps, type providers in the console. (Though some don’t work :/)\n\nUse addMarkers() or addCircles() to mark locations. Type ?addControl into the console to pull up a help file which summarizes the aesthetics of these markers and how you can change them. For example:\n\n\nweight = how thick to make the lines, points, pixels\n\nopacity = transparency (like alpha in ggplot2)\ncolors need to be in “hex” form. We used the col2hex() function from the gplots library to do that\n\n\nExercise 3: Your turn\nThe starbucks data, compiled by Danny Kaplan, contains information about every Starbucks in the world at the time the data were collected, including Latitude and Longitude:\n\n# Import starbucks location data\nstarbucks &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/starbucks.csv\")\n\nLet’s focus on only those in Minnesota for now:\n\n# Don't worry about the syntax\nstarbucks_mn &lt;- starbucks |&gt;   \n  filter(Country == \"US\", State.Province == \"MN\")\n\n\n# MN starbcuks map\nleaflet(data = starbucks_mn) |&gt; \n  addTiles() |&gt; \n  addMarkers(lng = ~Longitude, lat = ~Latitude)\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a leaflet map of the Starbucks locations in Minnesota. Keep it simple – go back to Exercise 1 for an example.\nPart 2: Static points on a map\nLeaflet is very powerful and fun. But:\n\nIt’s not great when we have lots of points to map – it takes lots of time.\nIt makes good interactive maps, but we often need a static map (eg: we can not print interactive maps!).\n\nLet’s explore how to make point maps with ggplot(), not leaflet().\nExercise 3: A simple scatterplot\nLet’s start with the ggplot() tools we already know. Construct a scatterplot of all starbucks locations, not just those in Minnesota, with:\n\nLatitude and Longitude coordinates (which goes on the y-axis?!)\nMake the points transparent (alpha = 0.2) and smaller (size = 0.2)\n\nIt’s pretty cool that the plots we already know can provide some spatial context. But what don’t you like about this plot?\n\nggplot(starbucks, aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude))+\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.2, size = 0.2)\n\nWarning: Removed 1 row containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Adding a country-level background\nLet’s add a background map of country-level boundaries.\nPart a\nFirst, we can grab country-level boundaries from the rnaturalearth package.\n\n# Load the package\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\n\n# Get info about country boundaries across the world\n# in a \"sf\" or simple feature format\nworld_boundaries &lt;- ne_countries(returnclass = \"sf\")\n\nIn your console, type world_boundaries to check out what’s stored there.

In the Fundamentals of Data Visualization, Wilke breaks down ineffective viz into 3 categories:\n\nWrong\nThe viz is “objectively incorrect”, as in the numbers / trends being displayed are wrong.\nBad\nThe viz is “unclear, confusing, overly complicated, or deceiving”.\nUgly\nThe viz correct and clear but The aesthetics are problematic.\n\nActivity: Critical Analysis\nLet’s try some critical analysis on specific examples. For your assigned viz, identify the following:\n\nThe story the viz is trying to communicate.\nWhether the viz is good, ugly, bad, wrong, or some combination.\nAreas for improvement.\n\n\n\n\n\nIMAGE 1.

The topic of effective viz is too big and nuanced to boil down into a simple list. Here are some basics:\nProfessionalism\nOnce you’re ready to “share out” your viz, it should have…\n\nmeaningful axis labels\na figure caption (depending upon where the viz will appear)\nAccessibility\nOnce you’re ready to “share out” your viz, it should…\n\nhave “alt text”, a written description of the viz that can be read out by a screen reader (video)\nuse a color palette that is distinguishable across common forms of color blindness\nDesign Details\nIn designing your viz, think about comparison. Good viz make it easy for people to perceive things that are similar and things that are different.\nEthics\nMichael Correll of Tableau Research (pdf) wrote “Data visualizations have a potentially enormous influence on how data are used to make decisions across all areas of human endeavor.” Thus ethics are critical from the data we use, to the plots we build, to the way in which we communicate this work. This is a very broad topic, and we’ll focus here on data visualization alone. Relatedly, and at a minimum:\n\nData viz should not mislead, i.e. “wrong” viz are unethical.**\nYet ethics in data viz goes much deeper. Correll describes three related principles to strive for:\n\nVisibility\nMake the invisible visible. Visualize hidden labor, hidden uncertainty, hidden impacts. Credit your sources, data and otherwise.\nPrivacy\nCollect data with empathy. Encourage small Data, anthropomorphize data, obfuscate data to protect privacy.\nPower\nChallenge structures of power. Support data due process, act as data advocates, pressure unethical analytical behavior.\n\n\nTo this list, Data Feminism authors Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein added:\n\nEmotion & Embodiment\nValue multiple forms of knowledge, including the knowledge that comes from people as living, feeling bodies in the world.\nPluralism\nThe most complete knowledge comes from synthesizing multiple perspectives\nContext\nData are not neutral or objective",

    "text": "11.2 Exercises\nExercise 1: Professionalism\nLet’s examine weather in 3 Australian locations.\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nThe following plot is fine for things like homework or just playing around. But we’ll make it more “professional” looking below.\n\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location)) + \n  geom_point()\n\nWarning: Removed 27 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart a\nReplace A, B, C, and D in the code below to:\n\nAdd a short, but descriptive title. Under 10 words.\nChange the x- and y-axis labels, currently just the names of the variables in the dataset. These should be short and include units.\nChange the legend title to “Location” (just for practice, not because it’s better than “location”).\n\n\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  labs(x = \"Temperature at 9AM (celcius)\", y = \"Temperature at 3 PM (celcius)\", title = \"Temperature in Australian Cities in the Morning vs the Afternoon\", color = \"Location\")  \n\nWarning: Removed 27 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nWhen we’re including our plot in an article, paper, book, or other similar outlet, we should (and are expected to) provide a more descriptive figure caption. Typically, this is instead of a title and is more descriptive of what exactly is being plotted.\n\nAdd a figure caption in the top of the chunk.\nInclude your x-axis, y-axis, and legend labels from Part a.\nRender your Rmd and check out how the figure caption appears.\n\n\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  labs(x = \"Temperature at 9 AM (celcius)\", y = \"Temperature at 3 PM(celcuis)\", color = \"City\")  \n\nWarning: Removed 27 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\nTemperature in Australian Cities in the morning compared to the afternoon\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2: Accessibility\nLet’s now make a graphic more accessible.\n\nggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + \n  labs(x = \"3pm temperature (Celsius)\")  \n\nWarning: Removed 19 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_density()`).\n\n\n\n\nDensity plots of 3pm temperatures in 3 Australian locations.\n\n\n\nPart a\nLet’s add some alt text that can be picked up by screen readers. This is a great resource on writing alt text for data viz. In short, whereas figure captions are quick descriptions which assume that the viz is accessible, alt text is a longer description which assumes the viz is not accessible. Alt text should concisely articulate:\n\nWhat your visualization is (e.g. a density plot of 3pm temperatures in Hobart, Uluru, and Wollongong, Australia).\nA 1-sentence description of the most important takeaway.\nA link to your data source if it’s not already in the caption.\n\nAdd appropriate alt text at the top of the chunk, in fig-alt. Then knit your Rmd, and hover over the image in your knitted html file to check out the alt text.\n\nggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + \n  labs(x = \"3pm temperature (Celsius)\")  \n\nWarning: Removed 19 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_density()`).\n\n\n\n\nDensity plots of 3pm temperatures in 3 Australian locations.\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nColor is another important accessibility consideration. Let’s check out the color accessibility of our density plot.\n\nRun the ggplot() code from Part a in your console. The viz will pop up in the Plots tab.\nIn the Plots tab, click “Export” then “Save as image”. Save the image somewhere.\nNavigate to https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/\n\nAbove the image of crayons (I think it’s crayons?), click “Choose file” and choose the plot file you just saved.\nClick the various simulator buttons (eg: Red-Weak/Protanomaly) to check out how the colors in this plot might appear to others.\nSummarize what you learn. What impact might our color choices have on one’s ability to interpret the viz?\nIt’s important to have highly contrasting colors, both between categories and the background. Also, green and blue and green and red can look similar in some instances\nPart c\nWe can change our color schemes! There are many color-blind friendly palettes in R. In the future, we’ll set a default, more color-blind friendly color theme at the top of our Rmds. We can also do this individually for any plot that uses color. Run the chunks below to explore various options.\n\nggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + \n  labs(x = \"3pm temperature (Celsius)\") + \n  scale_fill_viridis_d()    \n\nWarning: Removed 19 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_density()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# In the color scale line:\n# Change \"fill\" to \"color\" since we use color in the aes()\n# Change \"d\" (discrete) to \"c\" (continuous) since maxtemp is on a continuous scale\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = maxtemp)) + \n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + \n  labs(x = \"3pm temperature (Celsius)\") + \n  scale_color_viridis_c()\n\nWarning: Removed 27 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Ethics\nLet’s scratch the surface of ethics in data viz. Central to this discussion is the consideration of impact.\nPart a\nAt a minimum, our data viz should not mislead. Reconsider the climate change example from above. Why is this plot unethical and what impact might it have on policy, public opinion, etc?\n\nIt covers such a large amount of time that it appears there is no change however if you look in closely there is change and even small amount of climate change is harmful to the planet. This graph could make people believe climate change is not real.\n\n\nPart b\nAgain, data viz ethical considerations go beyond whether or not a plot is misleading. As described in the warm-up, we need to consider: visibility, privacy, power, emotion & embodiment, pluralism, & context. Depending upon the audience and goals of a data viz, addressing these points might require more nuance. Mainly, the viz tools we’ve learned are a great base or foundation, but aren’t the only approaches to data viz. \nPick one or more of the following examples of data viz to discuss with your group. How do the approaches taken:\n\nemphasize one or more of: visibility, privacy, power, emotion, embodiment, pluralism, and/or context?\nimprove upon what we might be able to convey with a simpler bar chart, scatterplot, etc?\n\n\nExample: W.E.B. Du Bois (1868–1963)\nDu Bois (“Doo Boys”) was a “sociologist, socialist, historian, civil rights activist, Pan-Africanist, author, writer, and editor”1. He was also a pioneer in elevating emotion and embodiment in data visualization. For the Paris World Fair of 1900, Du Bois and his team of students from Atlanta University presented 60 data visualizations of the Black experience in America, less than 50 years after the abolishment of slavery. Du Bois noted: “I wanted to set down its aim and method in some outstanding way which would bring my work to notice by the thinking world.” That is, he wanted to increase the impact of his work by partnering technical visualizations with design that better connects to lived experiences. NOTE: This work uses language common to that time period and addresses the topic of slavery. Check out:\n\nA complete set of the data visualizations provided by Anthony Starks (@ajstarks).\nAn article by Allen Hillery (@AlDatavizguy).\nThe graphs in this article are a great portrayal of this person’s emotions and feelings as they are documenting their personal experience with long covid. It also brings visibilty to the effects of long covid on people which many people may not know.\nI think the bar graphs in the article are nice looking. The bar chart is ok however there is a lot of data to interpret that at times it can be hard to read and understand\n\nExample: One person’s experience with long COVID\nNYT article\n\nExample: Decolonizing data viz\nblog post\n\nExample: Visualizing climate change through art\nFutures North with Prof John Kim & Mac students (by Prof Kim, Mac research students)\n\nExample: Personal data collection\nDear Data\n\nPart c\nFor a deeper treatment of similar topics, and more examples, read Data Feminism.\n\nExercise 4: Critique\nPractice critiquing some more complicated data viz listed at Modern Data Science with R, Exercise 2.5.\nThink about the following questions:\n\nWhat story does the data graphic tell? What is the main message that you take away from it?\nCan the data graphic be described in terms of the Grammar of Graphics (frame, glyphs, aesthetics, facet, scale, guide)? If so, please describe.\nCritique and/or praise the visualization choices made by the designer. Do they work? Are they misleading? Thought-provoking? Are there things that you would have done differently?\n\n\nExercise 5: Design Details\nThis final exercise is just “food for thought”. It’s more of a discussion than an exercise, and gets into some of the finer design details and data viz theory. Go as deep or not deep as you’d like here.\nIn refining the details of our data viz, Visualize This and Storytelling with Data provide some of their guiding principles. But again, every context is different.\n\nPut yourself in a reader’s shoes. What parts of the data need explanation?\nShine a light on your data. Try to remove any “chart junk” that distracts from the data.\nVary color and style to emphasize the viz elements that are most important to the story you’re telling.\nIt is easier to judge length than it is to judge area or angles.\nBe thoughtful about how your categories are ordered for categorical data.\n\nGetting into even more of the nitty gritty, we need to be mindful of what geometric elements and aesthetics we use. The following elements/aesthetics are listed in roughly descending order of human ability to perceive and compare nearby objects:2\n\nPosition\nLength\nAngle\nDirection\nShape (but only a very few different shapes)\nArea\nVolume\nShade\nColor. (Color is the most difficult, because it is a 3-dimensional quantity.)\n\nFinally, here are some facts to keep in mind about visual perception from Now You See It.\nPart a: Selectivity\nVisual perception is selective, and our attention is often drawn to contrasts from the norm.\nImplication: We should design visualizations so that the features we want to highlight stand out in contrast from those that are not worth the audience’s attention.\nExample: What stands out in this example image? This is originally from C. Ware, Information Visualization: Perception for Design, 2004? Source: S. Few, Now You See It, 2009, p. 33.\n\nThe reapting pattern stands out\n\n\nPart b: Familiarity\nOur eyes are drawn to familiar patterns. We observe what we know and expect.\nImplication: Visualizations work best when they display information as patterns that familiar and easy to spot.\nExample: Do you notice anything embedded in this rose image from coolbubble.com? Source: S. Few, Now You See It, 2009, p. 34.\n\nPart c: Revisit\nRevisit Part b. Do you notice anything in the shadows? Go to https://mac-stat.github.io/images/112/rose2.png for an image.",
