Use this file for practice with the **bivariate viz** in-class activity.  Refer to the class website for details.
## examples

```{r}
# Load data
elections <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_county.csv")

# Check it out
head(elections)
```

We'll use this data to explore voting outcomes within the U.S.'s 2-party system. Here's a list of candidates by year:

| year | Republican candidate | Democratic candidate |
|:-----|:---------------------|:---------------------|
| 2020 | Donald Trump         | Joe Biden            |
| 2016 | Donald Trump         | Hillary Clinton      |
| 2012 | Mitt Romney          | Barack Obama         |



### Exercise 0: Review {.unnumbered}

#### Part a {.unnumbered}

How many, or roughly what percent, of the 3000+ counties did the Republican candidate win in 2020?

-   Take a guess. 
  - 48%
-   Then make a plot of the `winner` variable.
-   Then discuss what follow-up questions you might have (and that our data might help us answer).
  - how many votes did each candidate get?

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20))+
  geom_bar()
```

#### Part b {.unnumbered}

The `repub_pct_20` variable provides more detail about the Republican support in each county. Construct a plot of `repub_pct_20`.

Notice that the distribution of Republican support from county to county is slightly **left skewed** or **negatively skewed**.

What follow-up questions do you have?

- How many votes did each county correlate to or in other words how many votes did they get from the correlating percent?

```{r}
ggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20))+
  geom_histogram(color = "white")
```


### Exercise 1: Quantitative vs Quantitative Intuition Check {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-important title="Be Quick"}

Don't spend more than 3 minutes on this! 

:::

Below is a **scatterplot** of the Republican support in 2020 vs 2016. Notice that:

-   both variables are quantitative, and get their own axes
-   the *response* variable is on the y-axis, demonstrating how `repub_pct_20` might be predicted by `repub_pct_16`, not vice versa

Try to replicate this using `ggplot()`. THINK:

-   What info do you need to set up the canvas?
-   What geometric layer (`geom_???`) might add these dots / points for each county? We haven't learned this yet, just take some guesses.

![](https://mac-stat.github.io/images/112/scatterplot_demo.png){width="50%"}

```{r}
ggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_16 , y = repub_pct_20))+
  geom_point()
```


### Exercise 2: 2 Quantitiative Variables {.unnumbered}

Run each chunk below to build up a a scatterplot of `repub_pct_20` vs `repub_pct_16` with different *glyphs* representing each county. Address or think about any prompts in the comments (`#`).

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Set up the plotting frame
# How does this differ than the frame for our histogram of repub_pct_20 alone? It has two depdent variables on it.
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16))
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Add a layer of points for each county
# Take note of the geom!
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Change the shape of the points
# What happens if you change the shape to another number? it changes the shape of the points
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +
  geom_point(shape = 1)
```

```{r}
# YOU TRY: Modify the code to make the points "orange"
# NOTE: Try to anticipate if "color" or "fill" will be useful here. Then try both.
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +
  geom_point(color = "orange")
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Add a layer that represents each county by the state it's in
# Take note of the geom and the info it needs to run! 
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = state_abbr))
```


### Exercise 3: Reflect {.unnumbered}

Summarize the relationship between the Republican support in 2020 and 2016. Be sure to comment on:

-   the strength of the relationship (weak/moderate/strong)\
-   the direction of the relationship (positive/negative)\
-   outliers (in what state do counties deviate from the national trend? Any ideas why this might be the case?)
-   It is a strong relation because it is mostly linear. The direction the realationship is positive as there is a increase in support from 2016 to 2020. DC and Texas seem to be an outliers 

### Exercise 4: Visualizing trend {.unnumbered}

The trend of the relationship between `repub_pct_20` and `repub_pct_16` is clearly positive and (mostly) linear. We can highlight this trend by adding a model "smooth" to the plot:

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

#### Part a {.unnumbered}

Construct a new plot that contains the model smooth but does *not* include the individual point glyphs.

```{r}
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_16 , x = repub_pct_20))+
  geom_smooth()
```

#### Part b {.unnumbered}

By default, `geom_smooth()` adds a smooth, localized model line. To examine the "best" *linear model*, we can specify `method = "lm"`. It's pretty similar in this example!

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```


### Exercise 5: Your Turn {.unnumbered}

To examine how the 2020 results are related to some county demographics, construct scatterplots of `repub_pct_20` vs `median_rent`, and `repub_pct_20` vs `median_age`. Summarize the relationship between these two variables and comment on which is the better predictor of `repub_pct_20`, `median_rent` or `median_age`.

- median rent is a better predictor as there is a strong negative association, the lower the rent the higher Republican support, while there is only a moderate postative association
```{r}
# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_rent
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = median_rent))+
  geom_point()


# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_age
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = median_age))+
  geom_point()



```


### Exercise 6: A Sad Scatterplot {.unnumbered}

Next, let's explore the relationship between a county's 2020 Republican support `repub_pct_20` and the `historical` political trends in its state. In this case `repub_pct_20` is **quantitative**, but `historical` is **categorical**. Explain why a scatterplot might *not* be an effective visualization for exploring this relationship. (What questions does / doesn't it help answer?)

```{r}
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +
  geom_point()
```


### Exercise 7: Quantitative vs Categorical -- Violins & Boxes {.unnumbered}

Though the above scatterplot *did* group the counties by `historical` category, it's nearly impossible to pick out meaningful patterns in 2020 Republican support in each category. Let's try adding 2 different `geom` layers to the frame:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Side-by-side violin plots
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +
  geom_violin()
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Side-by-side boxplots (defined below)
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

Box plots are constructed from five numbers - the minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum value of a quantitative variable:

**REFLECT:**

Summarize what you've learned about the 2020 Republican county-level support within and between red/purple/blue states.

  - there is decent amount of range in support each of the historical catagories but support tends to be higher in historically red counties and lower in blue

### Exercise 8: Quantitative vs Categorical -- Intuition Check {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-important title="Be Quick"}

Don't spend more than 3 minutes on this! 

:::

We can also visualize the relationship between `repub_pct_20` and `historical` using our familiar density plots. In the plot below, notice that we simply created a separate density plot for each `historical` category. (The plot itself is "bad" but we'll fix it below.) Try to adjust the code chunk below, which starts with a density plot of `repub_pct_20` alone, to re-create this image.

![](https://mac-stat.github.io/images/112/density_demo.png){width="50%"}

```{r}
ggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +
  geom_density()
```


### Exercise 9: Quantitative vs Categorical -- Density Plots {.unnumbered}

Work through the chunks below and address the comments therein.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# The colors don't match the labels
#the denisty plots are covering each other
ggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +
  geom_density()
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# scale_fill_manual changes the fill color of each catageory in the order you put it in
ggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +
  geom_density() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "purple", "red"))
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# alpha = 0.5 makes the fill color more transparent 
# Play around with different values of alpha, between 0 and 1
ggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "purple", "red"))
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# facet_wrap creates sepearate graphs for each historical group/catagory
ggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +
  geom_density() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "purple", "red")) +
  facet_wrap(~ historical)
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Let's try a similar grouping strategy with a histogram instead of density plot.
# This is terrible because it makes it hard to read the data, I can't tell what is trying to be visualized in this, each historical catagory is stacked on top of each making it difficult to know what its denisty is 
ggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "purple", "red"))+
```


### Exercise 10 {.unnumbered}

We've now learned 3 (of many) ways to visualize the relationship between a quantitative and categorical variable: side-by-side violins, boxplots, and density plots.

-   Which do you like best?
  - the density plot
-   What is one pro of density plots relative to boxplots?
  - it doesn't over simplify data as compared to boxplots which catagorizes data 
-   What is one con of density plots relative to boxplots?
  - box plots are easier to interpret


### Exercise 11: Categorical vs Categorical -- Intuition Check {.unnumbered}

Finally, let's simply explore who *won* each county in 2020 (`winner_20`) and how this breaks down by `historical` voting trends in the state. That is, let's explore the relationship between 2 categorical variables! Following the same themes as above, we can utilize grouping features such as fill/color or facets to distinguish between different categories of `winner_20` and `historical`.

::: {.callout-important title="Be Quick"}

Spend at most 5 minutes on the following intuition check. Adjust the code below to recreate the following two plots.

:::



![](https://mac-stat.github.io/images/112/barplot_demo.png){width="60%"}

```{r}
# Plot 1: adjust this to recreate the top plot
ggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +
  geom_bar()
```

```{r}
# Plot 2: adjust this to recreate the bottom plot
ggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +
  geom_bar()+
  facet_wrap(~ historical)
```


### Exercise 12: Categorical vs Categorical {.unnumbered}

Construct the following 4 bar plot visualizations.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# A stacked bar plot
# historical = x axis 
# winner = fill of bars
ggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +
  geom_bar()
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# A faceted bar plot
ggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~ historical)
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# A side-by-side bar plot
# Note the new argument to geom_bar = postion = dodge
ggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# A proportional bar plot
# Note the new argument to geom_bar postion = fill
ggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```

#### Part a {.unnumbered}

Name one pro and one con of using the "proportional bar plot" instead of one of the other three options.

  - One pro is that it makes easeir to compaer outcomes
  - one con is you are no longer able to count how many counties in each historical group

#### Part b {.unnumbered}

What's your favorite bar plot from part and why?

  - side by side beacuse it is easiet to read and allows you to keep count


### Exercise 13: Practice (now or later) {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-important title="Decide"}

Decide what's best for you:

-   Try this extra practice now.
-   Reflect on the above exercises and come back to this extra practice later (but before the next class).

:::

Import some daily weather data from a few locations in Australia:

```{r}
weather <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv")
```

Construct plots that address the research questions in each chunk. You might make multiple plots--there are many ways to do things!. However, don't just throw spaghetti at the wall.

Reflect before doing anything. What types of variables are these? How might you plot just 1 of the variables, and then tweak the plot to incorporate the other?

```{r}
# How do 3pm temperatures (temp3pm) differ by location?
ggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location))+
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)
  


```

```{r}
# How might we predict the 3pm temperature (temp3pm) by the 9am temperature (temp9am)?
ggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am))+
  geom_point()


```

```{r}
# How do the number of rainy days (raintoday) differ by location?
ggplot(weather, aes(x = location, fill = rain today))+
  geom_bar()
